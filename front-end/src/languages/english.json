  "auditorium_description": "Valanar Arangam (St. Joseph's Auditorium) – The old church, now known as Valanar Arangam, has been serving as a meeting hall for pastoral activities and as a function hall for the people since 2015. This strong stone-built structure, rich in tradition, has been carefully renovated and preserved to honor its heritage.",
  "about_title": "About Us",
  "about_para1": "We, the people of St. Joseph's Church parish, Kamplar, deeply cherish our Christian Faith and long Catholic heritage. Our parish belongs to the Roman Catholic diocese of Kuzhithurai. That our church is just 3.5 km away from Natalam, the native village of St. Devasahayam, adds to its spiritual significance.",
  "about_para2": "Our parish has about 225 families organized into seven Basic Christian Communities (Anbiams). It is a very active parish, led by our parish pastoral council, and having a plethora of apostolic associations and participatory structures to form us and to serve people.",
  "about_para3": "The stone-cross, belonging to St. Thomas' era, found at Devandivilai, within our parish, remains a witness, reminding us of the times of yore when Christian faith dawned upon us.",
  "about_para4": "Kamplar, once known for its Palmyra-based traditions and farming, still keeping its lush green environment, enjoys a pleasant climate with both Southwest and Northeast monsoons.",
  "about_para5": "St. Joseph's Church, Kamplar is located within Killiyoor Taluk, at the South-Western part of Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu. It lies (at 8°15'17''N and 77°12'46'') about 25 KM away from Nagercoil westward and about 50 KM from Thiruvananthapuram to the east.",
  "history_name":"Our History",
  "history_title": "St Joseph's Church, Kamplar",
  "history_para1":" Kamplar has a long history of adherence to Christian faith, mercifully led by God through waves of dramatic events, led by great parish priests and committed Catholic persons. The stone-cut Cross which has been venerated at Devandivilai, at the heart of Kamplar parish, whose style is ascribed to the times of St. Thomas the Apostle, is a certain witness to show that Christianity had gained foothold at Kamplar, even many centuries before the arrival of St. Xavier to Kanyakumari district. It is undisputable that Christianity at Kamplar was at least as old as the parish of Vencode, one of whose part Kamplar has always been. (That ancient cross has been transferred with due veneration to the front part of the new St. Joseph's Church, Kamplar, blessed in 2014).",
  "history_para2":"The date of building of St. Mary's Church over the above said stone-cut Cross at Devandivilai is shrouded in the shadows of remote past. Yet the fact that the primary school that was started at Kamplar in 1927 was named after St. Mary vouches to the fact that it was at least much older than that school. It is historical that the people of Kamplar were given permission to attend liturgical services at St. Mary's Church from 9-6-1946, having a separate administration, however continuing to be a substations of Vencode parish. St. Mary's Primary School was started at Kamplar in 1927 and it was catering to the early education of the people of Kamplar and unfortunately it was closed down in 1946.",
  "history_para3":"After about 15 years, considering the enhanced conveniences, Rev. Fr. Peter Lazar Christan, the then parish priest of Vencode, initiated building a new church at Kamplar, which was blessed on 26-7-1964, having St. Joseph as its patron. When Vizhunthayambalam was erected into a parish, Kamplar became its substation from Nov.13, 1984. Eventually, Kamplar was elevated to be a parish on Nov.9, 2008 at the recommendation of Rev. Fr. Benedict, having Fr. Arul Devadhasan as its first parish priest. The Golden Jubilee of St. Joseph's Church, Kamplar, was celebrated in a grand manner in July, 2014. In perpetual commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of St. Joseph's Church, a new church was built with the pastoral leadership of Fr. Arul Devadasan and full cooperation of the people. The new church was joyfully blessed on 25-7-2014, just a day before the Golden Jubilee.",
  "history_para4":"Together with the development of their places of worship, the people of Kamplar were also developing in their practice of Christian faith and in the other aspects of human life. The community has increased in size having more than 225 families now. It can boast of enviable human resource development with 100% literacy, decent educational qualifications and relative emancipation from poverty. The strong Christian motivation Kamplar people have, together with their deep faith in God and filial attachment to St. Joseph, will surely take them to new heights",
